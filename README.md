# guitar_fretboard_training

I will use this repository to work on an app which will help guitar players to improve their command of the guitar fretboard. The app will generate random chords, the advancing guitar player may then use the randomly generated chords to play triads and transition with the closest possible move on a chosen stringset. 

Later on this web App should systematically help guitar player getting better with added features. 

The purpose of this project is for me to learn software development, more specifically, I am using Python and Django for Web Development.

I have hosted this project on Heroku, please visit:
